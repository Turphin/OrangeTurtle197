- 👋 Hi, I’m @OrangeTurtle197!
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, coding, video games, and stuff like that (oh and turtles as well)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... everything you learn in middle school I guess?
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on anything I'm capable of (which is honestly not much).
- 📫 How to reach me ... yeahhhh... about that... I guess just email me at [orangeturtle197@gmail.com](mailto:orangeturtle197@gmail.com "My contact email")?
